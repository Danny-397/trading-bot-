## What is this?

TradeBot is a full-stack quantitative research platform that does something most student trading projects don't: **it asks whether its own results are real.**

Most backtesting tools show you a Sharpe ratio and stop there. This system goes further — after every simulation it applies three independent statistical tests borrowed from professional quant finance:

1. **Monte Carlo Resampling** (1,000 bootstrap paths) — does this strategy actually beat random?
2. **Deflated Sharpe Ratio** (Lopez de Prado, 2014) — is the Sharpe genuine after correcting for multiple-testing bias and non-normal returns?
3. **Fama-French 3-Factor Decomposition** — is the return actually alpha, or is it just passive exposure to known market risk premia that a factor ETF would replicate for free?

The system synthesizes all three into a verdict card: **STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT**, **PROMISING — NEEDS MORE DATA**, or **INCONCLUSIVE — MAY BE NOISE**.

Beyond validation, the platform includes a live trading bot, a backtesting engine with walk-forward cross-validation and transaction cost modeling, and a Markowitz portfolio optimizer that computes the efficient frontier via quadratic programming.

## What Makes This Different

| Typical student trading bot | This project |
|---|---|
| Fixed stop-loss from entry | Trailing stop — floor rises as price climbs, locking in gains |
| Fixed position sizing | Kelly Criterion sizing — fraction derived from historical win rate and odds ratio |
| Single strategy, single backtest | 4 strategies + adaptive mode; walk-forward out-of-sample testing |
| "My Sharpe is 1.4" | "My Sharpe is 1.4 and the Deflated Sharpe gives 91% probability it's real after testing 5 strategies" |
| Backtest return metric | Fama-French alpha decomposition — separates skill from passive factor exposure |
| No portfolio theory | Markowitz efficient frontier via quadratic programming; max-Sharpe and min-variance portfolios |
| No statistical context | Monte Carlo fan chart + Sharpe percentile rank vs 1,000 resampled paths |
| No market context | ADX + Bollinger Band Width + realized volatility regime detection; adaptive strategy selection |

---

## Feature Overview

### Trading Engine
- **4 Quantitative Strategies**: MA Crossover, RSI Mean Reversion, MACD Momentum, ML stub (ready for a trained model)
- **Adaptive Mode**: Detects the current market regime from SPY data and selects the optimal strategy automatically
- **Trailing Stop-Loss**: Exit floor rises with price — a position that runs up 12% can't turn into a loss
- **Kelly Criterion Sizing**: Position size is computed from the Kelly formula using live win rate and avg win/loss; falls back to fixed sizing when fewer than 10 closed trades exist
- **Risk Profiles**: Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive — each controls stop distance, take-profit target, position cap, cash reserve, and high-volatility behaviour
- **5-Minute Cycle**: Every five minutes during market hours the bot detects the regime, checks risk gates, sweeps stops, generates signals, and executes BUY/SELL orders

### Market Regime Detection
Classifies the market into four states using three independent indicators computed from SPY:

| Regime | Trigger | Default Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| TRENDING UP | ADX ≥ 25, +DI > −DI | MA Crossover |
| TRENDING DOWN | ADX ≥ 25, −DI > +DI | MA Crossover |
| RANGING | ADX < 20 | RSI Mean Reversion |
| HIGH VOLATILITY | 30-day realized vol > 25% | RSI (reduced size) |

Indicators: **ADX** (Wilder's smoothing), **Bollinger Band Width** (consolidation proxy), **30-day Annualised Realised Volatility**.

### Backtesting Engine
- **Day-by-day simulation** over any date range with any set of tickers
- **Walk-forward cross-validation**: train on first 70%, evaluate on final 30% only — prevents in-sample bias
- **Transaction costs**: configurable commission + slippage applied to every buy and sell
- **Rolling Kelly sizing**: position size updates after each closed trade using only trades *before* that date (no look-ahead)
- **Regime tagging**: every trade labelled with the market regime at execution time
- **SPY benchmark**: parallel simulation of buy-and-hold for alpha comparison
- **Calmar ratio**: annualised return / max drawdown — risk-adjusted metric used by hedge funds

### Statistical Validation
- **Monte Carlo (1,000 paths)**: resamples the daily return sequence with replacement; computes where the actual result ranks in the distribution of random paths. Fan chart shows P5/P25/P50/P75/P95 equity bands.
- **Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio (PSR)**: P(SR\_true > SR*) corrected for non-normality using skewness and excess kurtosis (Lopez de Prado, 2014, eq. 1)
- **Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR)**: PSR where the benchmark is the *expected maximum Sharpe from N independent random strategies*, scaling correctly with sample size via √(252/T). Tells you whether the best result from a search over strategies is real or just the luckiest of N.
- **Fama-French 3-Factor Decomposition**: OLS regression of portfolio excess returns against Mkt-RF, SMB (size), and HML (value) factors from Ken French's data library. Reports Jensen's alpha (annualised), factor betas, R², and per-coefficient t-statistics.

### Portfolio Optimizer
- **Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization** via `scipy.optimize.minimize` (SLSQP)
- Computes the **efficient frontier** (60 portfolios from min-variance to max return)
- Returns the **max-Sharpe (tangency) portfolio** and **global minimum-variance portfolio**
- Visualises individual asset risk/return scatter, optimal portfolio positions, and a **Pearson correlation heatmap**
- Optional integration with backtest: when `use_markowitz=true`, optimal weights replace the fixed `max_position_pct` in position sizing

### Risk Management (all enforced on every order)

| Rule | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trailing stop | 3% from peak | 5% from peak | 7% from peak |
| Take-profit | 10% from entry | 15% from entry | 20% from entry |
| Max position | 5% of portfolio | 10% of portfolio | 15% of portfolio |
| Cash reserve | 30% minimum | 20% minimum | 10% minimum |
| Daily trade cap | 6 | 10 | 15 |
| High-vol behaviour | Sits out entirely | Half-size positions | Full size |

### Dashboard & UI
- **Landing page**: clean green/black marketing page (`index.html`) — distinct from the blue app, links into the platform
- **Live dashboard**: portfolio value, open positions, equity curve, regime card, recent trades — auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
- **Backtest interface**: sticky sidebar form + 4-tab results (Performance / Monte Carlo / ⚗ Research / Trades)
- **Portfolio optimizer**: efficient frontier chart, optimal weight bar displays, correlation matrix heatmap
- **Strategy Validation Report**: synthesises Monte Carlo, DSR, and Fama-French into a single verdict with colour-coded confidence
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + Chart.js — zero frontend frameworks, zero build step

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danny-397/trading-bot-
cd trading-bot-
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

No API keys or brokerage account needed — the internal simulator handles order execution.

### 3. Run the backend
```bash
python backend/app.py
# → http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. Open the frontend
```bash
# Option A: open directly — index.html is the landing page;
# click "Launch Platform" to reach the dashboard
open frontend/index.html

# Option B: local dev server (avoids CORS issues)
python -m http.server 3000 -d frontend
# → http://localhost:3000  (dashboard at /dashboard.html)
```

### 5. Run the test suite
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
# 99 tests, all should pass
```

## Environment Variables

All environment variables are **optional** — the app runs out of the box with no configuration.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | No | Flask port (default: 5000) |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | No | SQLite path (default: `backend/tradebot.db`). Set to `/data/tradebot.db` on Render for persistence. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | No | Allowed CORS origins (default: `*`). Set to your Vercel URL in production. |

---

## Deployment

### Backend → Render

1. Push to GitHub
2. New Web Service → connect repo → root directory: `backend/`
3. Build: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start: `gunicorn app:app` (gunicorn.conf.py auto-discovered)
5. Environment variables (both optional):

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `/data/tradebot.db` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `https://your-project.vercel.app` |

`render.yaml` in the repo root configures all of this automatically — Render detects it on import.

**Persistent disk**: Add a Render disk mounted at `/data` — otherwise SQLite is wiped on every deploy. (`render.yaml` declares this disk for you.)

### Frontend → Vercel

1. New Project → root directory: `frontend/`
2. No build step needed (static files)
3. Set your Render backend URL in `frontend/config.js` (`window.RENDER_URL = '...'`) before deploying

### Deployment notes

- **`workers = 1` is mandatory.** `gunicorn.conf.py` enforces this. Multiple workers = multiple bot threads = duplicate orders against the same simulated account.
- **Render free tier spins down** after 15 min of inactivity. Use UptimeRobot (free) to ping `/health` every 10 minutes. The bot loop must be restarted from the dashboard after a cold start.
- **Backtest timeouts**: the Render default timeout is 30s; `gunicorn.conf.py` sets `timeout = 120` to accommodate long backtests with many tickers.

## Mathematical Background

### Kelly Criterion
`f* = (b·p − q) / b` where `b = avg_win / avg_loss`, `p = win_rate`, `q = 1 − p`.
Half-Kelly (`f* × 0.5`) is used in practice to reduce variance without sacrificing much expected growth. Falls back to fixed sizing until 10 closed trades exist.

### Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio (PSR)
`PSR(SR*) = Φ[(SR_hat − SR*) √(T−1) / √(1 − γ₃·SR_hat + (γ₄−1)/4·SR_hat²)]`
where γ₃ = skewness, γ₄ = raw kurtosis. Corrects the naive Sharpe comparison for fat tails and finite sample size.
Source: *Lopez de Prado, M. (2014). "The Deflated Sharpe Ratio." Journal of Portfolio Management.*

### Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR)
DSR = PSR where `SR* = E[max Sharpe | N strategies]`.
`SR* = (1−γ)Φ⁻¹(1−1/N) + γΦ⁻¹(1−1/(Ne))`, scaled by `√(252/T)` for the actual sample size.
γ ≈ 0.5772 (Euler–Mascheroni constant). A DSR > 95% indicates the best strategy is unlikely to be the luckiest of N random strategies.

### Fama-French 3-Factor Model
`R_p − R_f = α + β_mkt(R_m−R_f) + β_smb·SMB + β_hml·HML + ε`
Solved via OLS (`numpy.linalg.lstsq`). Factor data downloaded daily from Kenneth French's data library (Dartmouth). Alpha with |t| > 2 is considered statistically significant.
Source: *Fama, E. F. & French, K. R. (1993). "Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds." Journal of Financial Economics.*

### Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization
`min w^T Σ w` s.t. `Σw = 1, w_i ≥ 0` (long-only, fully invested).
Max-Sharpe: minimise `−(w^T μ − r_f) / √(w^T Σ w)`.
Solved with `scipy.optimize.minimize(method='SLSQP')`. All annualisation uses 252 trading days.
